# FinalProjDungeonEscape
Dungeon Escape Final Project for CTIS

**Running instructions** : 
simply add all project files including pom.xml, and src folder to your IDE of choice and in the terminal in the location of the project run, mvn javafx:run. 
You may have to install mvn(maven) commands before you can use the mvn command in the terminal

If the app doesn't run, then I recommend using the IntelliJ Idea IDE to run directly from the IDE or you can try running it directly from whichever 
IDE you are using.
